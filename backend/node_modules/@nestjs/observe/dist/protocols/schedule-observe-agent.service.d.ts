/**
 * Scheduled job instrumentation for `@nestjs/schedule`.
 *
 * A `@Cron`, `@Interval` or `@Timeout` handler fires from a timer, so no
 * request ever reaches it and none of the protocol agents see it run. Left
 * alone, a nightly job that takes twenty minutes or fails every other night is
 * invisible: the instance decorator only records spans inside a trace, and
 * nothing opened one.
 *
 * `ScheduleExplorer` routes every handler it discovers through
 * `wrapFunctionInTryCatchBlocks(methodRef, instance)` before registering it
 * with the orchestrator - one seam that covers all three decorators. It is
 * patched on the prototype from this constructor, which Nest runs while it is
 * still instantiating providers and therefore strictly before any
 * `onModuleInit`, including the explorer's own, where discovery happens. The
 * explorer's wrapper is kept and ours goes inside it, so a throwing handler is
 * still logged by the scheduler exactly as before - it is just also reported.
 *
 * Each execution is reported as a job snapshot, the same shape BullMQ jobs
 * use: the scheduler type stands in for the queue name and the handler for the
 * job name, so `cron / ReportsService.nightly` sits alongside
 * `emails / send-welcome` in the same view.
