/**
 * GraphQL operation instrumentation.
 *
 * Nest serves GraphQL as raw middleware mounted on a single path, so from
 * HTTP's point of view every operation a service handles is one `POST /graphql`
 * with no route handler behind it. That is a problem in both directions: the
 * trace has no spans, so `OperationTraceRegistry.endTrace` discards it as a
 * request that never reached a handler, and even if it survived, every query
 * and mutation in the schema would aggregate into a single row.
 *
 * `@nestjs/graphql` exposes `ResolverDecoratorHost`, whose request-lifecycle
 * hooks bracket a single operation: `setOnRequestStartHook` fires before the
 * document is processed, `setOnRequestEndHook` once it has been, right before
 * the response goes out. Whatever the start hook returns is handed back as
 * `state`, which is what lets one span be opened in the first and closed in the
 * second. This service claims both and gives each operation a span.
 *
 * The span goes into the trace the HTTP agent already opened whenever there is
 * one, which keeps the shape a reader expects: one snapshot per HTTP request,
 * with `Query.orders` as the operation id and the operation - plus every
 * instrumented provider it reached - as the trace tree underneath. Only when no
 * such trace exists does this service open one of its own.
 *
 * Measuring the operation rather than each root field is the point of using
 * these hooks over the resolver decorator they replace. A span now covers
 * parsing, validation and execution together, which is the number a client
 * actually waited for; a document selecting several root fields is one span
 * instead of several competing to name the trace; and a resolver that calls
 * nothing instrumented still produces a trace rather than being discarded for
 * having recorded no spans.
