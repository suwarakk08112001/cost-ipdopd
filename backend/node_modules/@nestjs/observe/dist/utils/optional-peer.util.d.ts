/**
 * Loads an optional peer dependency without a static import, so a service
 * that does not use the feature need not install the package.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose: every caller patches or subscribes during provider
 * instantiation or `onModuleInit`, strictly before the peer's own lifecycle
 * runs, and a dynamic `import()` would resolve too late. All current peers
 * ship CommonJS, so `require` can load them.
 *
 * The package's presence is probed with `require.resolve(packageName)` before
 * `specifier` (which may be a deep path into the package) is required, so
 * "not installed" is kept apart from "installed but broken or reshaped".
 * `createRequire` itself failing - a CJS bundle that erased `import.meta.url`,
 * say - is treated as "not installed": with no resolver there is nothing to
 * load, and crashing the constructor would defeat the point of the peer being
 * optional.
 *
 * A deep specifier that an `exports` map refuses (Nest v12 added one to
 * several packages) is retried as an absolute path built from the package's
 * own `package.json` - always exported, and an absolute path is not subject
 * to the map. The file still has to be there, so a genuinely moved or removed
 * entry keeps reporting its own failure.
