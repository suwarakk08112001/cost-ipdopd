/**
 * Masks the values of sensitive query parameters in a request URL.
 *
 * Applied by default, unlike `queryParamsObfuscateRegex`, which is opt-in and
 * so protects only the deployments that already know to ask. The URL of a
 * request is stored on every row of `request_telemetry` and rendered in the UI,
 * and the things routinely carried in a query string - password reset tokens,
 * invite tokens, OAuth codes, signed URL signatures - are exactly the things
 * that must not be readable there weeks later.
 *
 * Keys are kept and only values replaced: knowing a request carried a `token`
 * is useful when reading a trace, and knowing which token is not.
 *
 * Values are not inspected, only keys. A regex hunting for token-shaped strings
 * anywhere in a URL mangles ordinary path segments and ids, and a redactor that
 * mangles real data is one somebody switches off.
